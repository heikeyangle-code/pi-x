# Claude Authentication Troubleshooting

CC Pocket uses the Claude Code login state stored on your Bridge machine.
If authentication fails, sign in to Claude Code again on that machine.

## If You Are Not Near Your Bridge Machine

With CC Pocket, your Bridge machine may be a Mac mini or another Mac running at home.
Even in that case, you can log back into Claude Code remotely from your phone.

1. Connect to the Bridge machine from a terminal app
   - Moshi, Termius, Blink, or any SSH client works
2. Run `claude`
3. Run `/login` inside Claude Code
4. Open the displayed URL on your phone or PC
5. Complete sign-in in the browser
6. Paste the result back into the terminal if prompted

CC Pocket will use the updated login on the next request.

## If You Are Near Your Bridge Machine

1. Run `claude` on the Bridge machine
2. Run `/login`
3. Complete the browser sign-in flow

## Shell Alternative

If you prefer, you can also run:

```bash
claude auth login
```

## When This Happens

- Your Claude login expired
- Claude Code was updated and the old login became invalid
- Anthropic revoked the saved token
